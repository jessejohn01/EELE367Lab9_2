# EELE367Lab9_2

The purpose of this lab was to demonstrate a finite state machine in VHDL and integrating it with a DE0-CV FPGA board. By diagraming the finite state machine in VHDL we are able to make an LED row "walk" up or down based on a switch input. We need to utilize a prior built ripple counter to slow down the clock cycle so that the human eye can perceive the LED changing.
